# CS340-Full-Stack-MongoDB-Project
Final Project for CS340


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The first strategy I use to help make my code readable is to include a lot of comments. It helps to understand what your code is capable of by including tips and comments around important parts. Naming variables apropriately is also important. Including sections of your code that handle errors is crucial. Error messages that help tell the user that there were no results help the user understand that the issue may have been with their query. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first step I take to approaching a problem is figuring out what the first step will be toward a potential solution. Most of the issues I had while working on the animal control system had to do with the configuration. Things like not having the correct name for the database I was using, or making a typo in the username and password were both issues I had to deal with. It helps to look at the error codes that were returned, like with the authentication failure. Configuring Jupyter to open with the console was essential to figure out a few of the issues I was having.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

We solve problems using computers as tools. We can get a computer to perform a certain task for someone that solves a real life problem for them. For this company, they can be more efficient with their record keeping, saving money. They also have access to more information about their businiss which enables them to make more intelligent decisions.
